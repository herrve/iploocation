# iploocation
 a Python script that you can use to get the location of an IP address

 This script uses the ipapi.co API to get the location of an IP address. The API provides a variety of information about an IP address, including the country, region, city, latitude, and longitude. The script simply requests the JSON data from the API and then prints the location information to the console.

You can use this script to get the location of any IP address. For example, if you wanted to get the location of my IP address, you would run the script like this:

# Code snippet
python ip_location.py

The script would then print the following output to the console:

# Code snippet
The location of the IP address 172.217.0.1 is: [Country], [City], etc...

# In windows
run: pip install requests
then run: python iplocation.py
